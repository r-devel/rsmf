# RSMF Project: Enabling the Next Generation of Contributors to R

This repository is for managing work related to the project "Enabling the Next Generation of Contributors to R", which aims to 
 * Build collaboration between R Core developers and R contributors.
 * Establish a cohort of expert R contributors.
 * Support broader engagement in R contribution.
 * Improve communication between R Core and the wider community.
   
For more details see the [R Blog post](https://blog.r-project.org/2025/12/17/rsmf-enabling-the-next-generation-of-contributors-to-r/index.html) announcing the project.

This repository is intended primarily for discussions among the [RSMF Project Team](#rsmf-project-team) and partner collaborators. However, we welcome comments from experienced R developers/contributors and some projects will be open to external collaborators.

> [!NOTE]  
> Work under this project is not suitable for novice contributors. If you are new to contributing to R, we recommend visiting the [R Contributor Site](https://contributor.r-project.org/) to find out how to get started.
